Worst-Case Big-O Notation

Task0:
> Worse case complexity: O(n)
> Algorithm:
    > Print resulting string to console (complexity: O(1))
    > Print resulting string to console (complexity: O(1))

Task1:
> Worse case complexity: O(n) + O(n)
> Algorithm:
    > Initialize an empty set (complexity: O(1))
    > Map through calls and add call[0] and call[1] to the set (complexity: O(n))
    > Map through texts and add text[0] and text[1] to the set (complexity: O(n))
    > Print resulting string to console (complexity: O(1))

Task2:
> Worse case complexity: O(n) + O(n)
> Algorithm:
    > Declare 2 variables and an empty dictionary (complexity: O(1))
    > Loop through calls to sum the duration of calls for every unique number 
      and add them to the dictionary (complexity: O(n))
    > Loop through unique numbers to find the longest time (complexity: O(n))
    > Print resulting string to console (complexity: O(1))

Task3:
> Worse case complexity: O(n) + O(n) + O(n)
> Algorithm:
    > Declare 2 empty dictionaries and a variable (complexity: O(1))
    > Loop through calls (complexity: O(n)):
        > Get area code in number (from) (complexity: O(1))
        > Get area code in number (to) (complexity: O(1))
        > Check if from and to are from area code '(080)' and add to counter (complexity: O(1))
        > Save `from` area codes in dictionary (complexity: O(1))
        > Save `to` area codes in dictionary (complexity: O(1))
    > Print numbers called (complexity: O(n) + O(n))
    > Print percent of calls from fixed lines (complexity: O(1))

Task4:
> Worse case complexity: O(n) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n)
> Algorithm:
    > Declare empty dictionary (complexity: O(1))
    > Loop through all calls to count the number of in/out calls per number (complexity: O(n))
    > Loop through all texts to count the number of in/out texts per number (complexity: O(n))
    > Loop through and print possible telemarketers (complexity: O(n) + O(n))
